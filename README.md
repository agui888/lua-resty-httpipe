# Connection

## new

`syntax: hp, err = httpipe:new(chunk_size?)`

Creates the httpipe object. In case of failures, returns `nil` and a string describing the error.

The argument, `chunk_size`, specifies the buffer size used by cosocket reading operations. Defaults to `8192`.

## set_timeout

`syntax: hp:set_timeout(time)`

Sets the timeout (in ms) protection for subsequent operations, including the `connect` method.

## set_keepalive

`syntax: ok, err = hp:set_keepalive(max_idle_timeout, pool_size)`

Attempts to puts the current connection into the ngx_lua cosocket connection pool.

**Note** Normally, it will be called automatically after processing the request. In other words, we cannot release the connection back to the pool unless you consume all the data.

You can specify the max idle timeout (in ms) when the connection is in the pool and the maximal size of the pool every nginx worker process.

In case of success, returns 1. In case of errors, returns nil with a string describing the error.

## get_reused_times

`syntax: times, err = hp:get_reused_times()`

This method returns the (successfully) reused times for the current connection. In case of error, it returns `nil` and a string describing the error.

If the current connection does not come from the built-in connection pool, then this method always returns `0`, that is, the connection has never been reused (yet). If the connection comes from the connection pool, then the return value is always non-zero. So this method can also be used to determine if the current connection comes from the pool.

## close

`syntax: ok, err = hp:close()`

Closes the current connection and returns the status.

In case of success, returns `1`. In case of errors, returns `nil` with a string describing the error.


# Requesting

## request

`syntax: res, err = hp:request(host, port, opts?)`

`syntax: res, err = hp:request("unix:/path/to/unix-domain.socket", opts?)`

The `opts` table accepts the following fields:

* `version`: Sets the HTTP version. Use `0` for HTTP/1.0 and `1` for HTTP/1.1. Defaults to `1`.
* `method`: The HTTP method string. Defaults to `GET`.
* `path`: The path string. Default to `/`.
* `query`: Specifies query parameters. Accepts either a string or a Lua table.
* `headers`: A table of request headers. Accepts a Lua table.
* `body`: The request body as a string, or an iterator function.
* `timeout`: Sets the timeout in milliseconds for network operations. Defaults to `5000`.
* `read_timeout`: Sets the timeout in milliseconds for network read operations specially.
* `send_timeout`: Sets the timeout in milliseconds for network send operations specially.
* `stream`: Specifies special stream mode, `FULL` and `BODY` is currently optional.

Returns a `res` object containing four attributes:

* `res.status` (number)
: The resonse status, e.g. 200
* `res.headers` (table)
: A Lua table with response headers.
* `res.body` (string)
: The plain response body.
* `res.eof` (int)
: If `res.eof` is `true` indicate already consume all the data; Otherwise, the request there is still no end, you need call `hp:close` to close the connection forcibly.

**Note** All headers (request and response) are noramlized for
capitalization - e.g., Accept-Encoding, ETag, Foo-Bar, Baz - in the
normal HTTP "standard."

If the stream specified as `FULL` mode, res is always a empty Lua table. You need to use `hp:response` or `hp:read` method to parse the full response specially.

If the stream specified as `BODY` mode, res containing the parsed `status` and `headers`. You also need to use `hp:read_body` method to read the response body specially.

In case of errors, returns nil with a string describing the error.

## response

`syntax: local res, err = hp:response(callback?)`

The `callback` table accepts the following fields:

* `header_filter`: A callback function for response headers filter

````lua
local res, err = hp:response{
    header_filter = function (status, headers)
        if status == 200 then
        	return 1
        end
end }
````

* `body_filter`: A callback function for response body filter

````lua
local res, err = hp:response{
    body_filter = function (chunk)
        ngx.print(chunk)
    end
}
````

**Note** When `return 1	` in callback functionï¼Œfilter process will be interrupted.

Returns a res object containing four attributes, as same as `hp:request` method.

In case of errors, returns nil with a string describing the error.

## read

`syntax: local typ, res, err = hp:read()`

Streaming parser for the full response.

The user just needs to call the read method repeatedly until a nil token type is returned. For each token returned from the read method, just check the first return value for the current token type. The token type can be `statusline`, `header`, `header_end`, `body`, `body_end` and `eof`. About the format of `res` value, please refer to the above example. For example, several body tokens holding each body data chunk, so `res` value is equal to the body data chunk.

In case of errors, returns nil with a string describing the error.

## read_body

`syntax: local chunk, err = hp:read_body()`

Streaming reader for the response body.

In case of success, it returns the data received; in case of error, it returns nil with a string describing the error.

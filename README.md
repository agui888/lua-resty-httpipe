# Connection

## new

`syntax: hp, err = httpipe:new(sock?, chunk_size?)`

Creates the httpipe object. In case of failures, returns `nil` and a string describing the error.

The first optional argument, `sock`, can be used to specify the readable TCP socket for response parsing, such as `ngx.req.socket`. With it, you do not need to call `reqeust` method any more.

The second optional argument, `chunk_size`, specifies the buffer size used by cosocket reading operations. Defaults to `8192`.

## set_timeout

`syntax: hp:set_timeout(time)`

Sets the timeout (in ms) protection for subsequent operations, including the `connect` method.

## close

`syntax: ok, err = hp:close(force?)`

Normally, it will call `hp:close()` method automatically after processing the request.

When HTTP/1.1 request without `Connection: close` header or HTTP/1.0 with `Connection: keep-alive` header, `hp:close()` method will call `sock:set_keepalive` immediately puts the current connection into the ngx_lua cosocket connection pool; Otherwise, it will call `sock:close()` to close the connection.

Requests cannot release the connection back to the pool unless you consume all the data or call `hp:close(1)` to close the connection forcibly.

In case of success, returns 1. In case of errors, returns nil with a string describing the error.

# Requesting

## request

`syntax: ok, err = hp:request(host, port, opts?)`

The `opts` table accepts the following fields:

* `version`: Sets the HTTP version. Use `0` for HTTP/1.0 and `1` for HTTP/1.1. Defaults to `1`.
* `method`: The HTTP method string. Defaults to `GET`.
* `path`: The path string. Default to `/`.
* `query`: Specifies query parameters. Accepts either a string or a Lua table.
* `headers`: A table of request headers. Accepts a Lua table.
* `body`: The request body as a string.
* `timeout`: Sets the timeout in milliseconds for network operations. Defaults to `5000`.
* `read_timeout`: Sets the timeout in milliseconds for network read operations specially.
* `send_timeout`: Sets the timeout in milliseconds for network send operations specially.

In case of success, returns 1. In case of errors, returns nil with a string describing the error.

## receive

`syntax: local res, err = hp:receive(callback?)`

The `callback` table accepts the following fields:

* `header_filter`: A callback function for response headers filter

````lua
local res, err = from:receive{
    header_filter = function (status, headers)
        if status == 200 then
        	return 1
        end
end }
````

* `body_filter`: A callback function for response body filter

````lua
local res1, err = hp:receive{
    header_filter = function (chunk)
        ngx.print(chunk)
    end
}
````

**Note** When `return 1	` in callback functionï¼Œreceive process will be interrupted.

Returns a `res` object containing three attributes:

* `res.status` (number)
: The resonse status, e.g. 200
* `res.headers` (table)
: A Lua table with response headers. 
* `res.body` (string)
: The plain response body
* `res.eof` (int)
: If `res.eof == 1` indicate already consume all the data; Otherwise, the request there is still no end, you need call `hp:close(1)` to close the connection forcibly.

**Note** All headers (request and response) are noramlized for
capitalization - e.g., Accept-Encoding, ETag, Foo-Bar, Baz - in the
normal HTTP "standard."

In case of errors, returns nil with a string describing the error.

## read

`syntax: local typ, res, err = hp:read()` 

Streaming parser for the response data.

The user just needs to call the read method repeatedly until a nil token type is returned. For each token returned from the read method, just check the first return value for the current token type. The token type can be `statusline`, `header`, `header_end`, `body`, `body_end` and `eof`. About the format of `res` value, please refer to the above example. For example, several body tokens holding each body data chunk, so `res` value is equal to the body data chunk.

In case of errors, returns nil with a string describing the error.

## write

`syntax: local bytes, err = hp:write(chunk)`

Sends data without blocking on the current httpipe connection.

This method is a synchronous operation that will not return until all the data has been flushed into the system socket send buffer or an error occurs.

In case of success, it returns the total number of bytes that have been sent. Otherwise, it returns nil and a string describing the error.
